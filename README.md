# INX-Future-Inc-Employee-Performance-Analysis-using-Power-BI
Created Interactive Dashboard &amp; Analyzed core underlying causes of poor employee performance

## **Project Objective**

Mr Brain, CEO of the **INX Future Inc data analytics and automation solutions** provider wants us to create an interactive dashboard to analyse the employee performance indexes and track the core underlying causes of their performance issues (clear indicators of non-performing employees).

## **Case Statement**
- Get a quick view of the share of F&B spending from existing customers (restaurants) that **Shaun's F&B Company** is getting, and if there are any opportunities in specific segments.
- What are the adjacent opportunities from the **_non-commercial establishments_** to additionally sell into (note that there are no customers currently in the non-commercial segment). Their data of spending are not available, so will be interested in knowing relevant proxies that could indicate opportunities for us.
- **_Retailers_** are a different business division and out of scope for me (Shaun), but some of my customers/prospects could be buying from these retailers â€“ so getting a view of retailer presence adjacent to his customers & prospects will help understand how much of these opportunities are being met / unmet.
