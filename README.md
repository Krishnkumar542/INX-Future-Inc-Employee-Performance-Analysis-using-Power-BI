## **Project Insight**

- Out of the 1200 employees, 178 of them going to leave INX Future Inc data analytics company (indicating a 15% attrition rate). 
- The employees with educational backgrounds in the field of Life Sciences (37%), Medical (25%) and Marketing (17%), indicating high attrition.
- The maximum number of employees between 26 - 35 age, depicts high attrition (90 employees).
- The employees from the job role of sales executive (44), developer (40), sales representative (24), research scientist (13) and manager R&D (12) show high attrition.
- The 46 employees after gaing two years of work experience they leave the company.
- The low salary hike % of employees (between 10% - 15%) indicates the high attrition rate.


## **Final Conclusion**

Based on educational background and job roles, the major cause of employee performance issues is job satisfaction and salary hike percentage. Especially, young employees between 26 - 35 age group in the job role of Sales Executive and Developer. Therefore, Mr Brain, CEO of INX Future Inc should raise the salary hike percentage (more than 15%) of young employees (between 26 - 35 age) who have at least two years of working experience at the company.
