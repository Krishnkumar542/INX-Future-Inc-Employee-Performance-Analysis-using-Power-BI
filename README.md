## **Project Insight**

- Out of the 1200 employees, 178 of them going to leave INX Future Inc data analytics company (indicating a 15% attrition rate). 
- The employees with educational backgrounds in the field of Life Sciences (37%), Medical (25%) and Marketing (17%), indicating high attrition.
- The maximum number of employees between 26 - 35 age, depicts high attrition (90 employees).
- The employees from the job role of sales executive (44), developer (40), sales representative (24), research scientist (13) and manager R&D (12) show high attrition.
- The 46 employees after gaing two years of work experience they leave the company.
- The low salary hike % of employees (between 10% - 15%) indicates the high attrition rate.


## **Final Conclusion**

Based on educational background and job roles, the major cause of employee performance issues is job satisfaction and salary hike percentage. Especially, young employees between 26 - 35 age group in the job role of Sales Executive, Developer and others. Therefore, Mr Brain, CEO of INX Future Inc should raise the salary hike percentage (increase to more than 15%) of young employees (between 26 - 35 age) who have at least two years of working experience at the company.
